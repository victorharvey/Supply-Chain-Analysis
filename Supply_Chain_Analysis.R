# VISUALISATIONS

## Recurring Order by Product
ggplot(data=data, 
       aes(x=Product.type, fill = Product.type)
       ) + geom_bar() + ggtitle("Product Type Sales")
### Skin Care seems to be the most recurring product

## Price v Revenue Generated
ggplot(data = data, 
       aes(x = Price, y = Revenue.generated)
       ) + geom_point() + ggtitle("Price v Revenue Generated")
### There is no trend between price and revenue generated per product

## Customer Purchase Distribution
ggplot(data = data, 
       aes(x = Product.type, y = Customer.demographics, Name)
       ) + geom_tile(aes(fill = Number.of.products.sold),
                     colour = "white"
                     ) + scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "steelblue"
                                             ) + ggtitle("Customer Product Purchase Heatmap")
### We see that men tend to buy cosmetics and skincare products. 
### Women tend to buy haircare and skincare. 
### Non-binary seem to be equally distributed. 
### There is a group on unknown gender who tend to buy more Cosmetics.
### This unknown group should be investigated further.

## Purchase Distribution Among Customer Demographic
ggplot(data = data, 
       aes(x = Price, fill = Product.type)
       ) + geom_histogram() + facet_wrap(~Customer.demographics
                                         ) + ggtitle("Purchase Distribution Among Customer Demographic")
### Men buy our products across the price range with a slight preference for cheaper and expensive
### Female tend to buy across the price range but with a heavy preference for cheaper products
### Non-binary tend to buy across the price range but with a heavy preference around the median
### Unknown tend to buy across the price range but with a heavy preference for expensive products
### This raises even more questions on who are the unknown and how can we maximize their shopping

## Product Type v Price
ggplot(data = data, 
       aes(x = Product.type, y = Price, fill = Product.type)
       ) + geom_violin(width = 1.0) + geom_boxplot(width = 0.1) + ggtitle("Product Type v Price")
### Cosmetics are the most expensive products by average and weighted on the expensive side.
### Hair care is the second most expensive product on average but evenly distributed.
### Skincare is the cheapest product on average and weighted on the cheaper side.

## Product Type v Gross Margin
ggplot(data = data, 
       aes(x = Product.type, y = Gross.Margin.Per.Product, fill = Product.type)
       ) + geom_violin(width = 1.0
                       ) + geom_boxplot(width = 0.1
                                        ) + ggtitle("Product Type v Gross Margin")
### On average we seem to make Gross Profit on Cosmetics, very little on hair care and skincare products.
### This lays more emphasis on reaching the Unknown customer segment and driving demand for cosmetics.
### It also lays the question of whether er should discontinue some products.

## Product Type v Product Lead Time
ggplot(data = data, 
       aes(x = Product.type, y = Product.Lead.Time, fill = Product.type)
       ) + geom_violin(width = 1.0
                       ) + geom_boxplot(width = 0.1
                                        ) + ggtitle("Product Type v Product Lead Time")
## Cosmetics has the highest average product lead time from us to the customer. 
## Skincare has the second highest product lead time but has extreme outliers.
## Further investigation shows that even Cosmetics has the longest lead time and weighted at the extreme.
## Skincare though has extreme outliers but weighted around the median.
## Our most profitable product seems to be also our longest lead time. Resources should be used to reduce this.


## Supplier v Carrier v Route Distribution
data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Product.type, fill = Shipping.carriers)
         ) + geom_bar() + facet_wrap(~Transportation.modes
                                     ) + ggtitle("Supplier v Carrier v Route Distribution")
### Carrier A is used across the product spectrum except for Cosmetics through Air
### Carrier B is used across the product spectrum except for Cosmtics through Sea
### Carrier C is used acrooss the product spectrum but rarely dominates
### Further investigation should be along the lines of which carrier to prioritise


## Shipping Carrier v Shipping Costs
ggplot(data = data, 
       aes(x = Shipping.carriers, y = Shipping.costs, fill = Shipping.carriers)
       ) + geom_violin(width = 1.0
                       ) + geom_boxplot(width = 0.1
                                        ) + ggtitle("Supplier v Carrier v Route Distribution")
### Carrier A is the cheapest on average and weighted around the mean. 
### Carrier C is the second cheapest but weighted on the expensive end.
### Carriers B is the most expensive but evenly distributed.

## Production Volumes v Manufacturing Costs
ggplot(data = data, 
       aes(x = Production.volumes, 
           y = Manufacturing.costs)
       ) +geom_point() + ggtitle("Production Volumes v Manufacturing Costs")
### There doesnt seem to be a correlation between how much we produce and its cost

## Production Volumes v Manufacturing Lead Times
ggplot(data = data, 
       aes(x = Production.volumes, 
           y = Manufacturing.lead.time)
       ) +geom_point() + ggtitle("Production Volumes v Manufacturing Lead Times")
### Through eyeballing the graph there does seem to be a slight correlation between production volume and how long to manufacture
### There may be case for increasing demand accuracy to reduce the risk in increasing production volumes

## Production Volumes v Supplier Lead Times
ggplot(data = data, 
       aes(x = Production.volumes, y = Supplier.Lead.Time)
       ) +geom_point() + ggtitle("Production Volumes v Supplier Lead Times")
### There doesnt seem to be a correlation between how much we produce and how quickly we can get it

## Supplier v Revenue Generated
ggplot(data = data, 
       aes(x = Supplier.name, 
           y = Revenue.generated, fill = Product.type)
       ) + geom_bar(stat='identity') + ggtitle("Supplier v Revenue Generated")
### Supplier 1 supplies the revenue generating products. They should be a close relationship with them.
### There most revenue generating product is skincare which happens to be our most recurring sales.
### Most of the top 4 suppliers supply significant amounts of skincare products.
### Most of the top 4 suppliers supply significant amount of cosmetic products.
### Supplier 2 supplies a significant supply of haircare

## Supplier v Shipping Location
ggplot(data = data,
       aes(x = Supplier.name,
           fill = Location)
       ) + geom_bar() + ggtitle("Supplier v Shipping Location")
### Suppliers seem to be equally distributed across locations.

## Lead Times by Supplier Location
ggplot(data = data, 
       aes(x = Location, 
           y = Supplier.Lead.Time, 
           fill = Location)
       ) + geom_violin(width = 1.0
                       ) + geom_boxplot(width = 0.1
                                        ) + ggtitle("Lead Times by Supplier Location")
### On average products coming from Chennai and Bangalore have longer lead times followed by Bangalore

## Correlation Matrix of the entire data
numeric_data <- select_if(data, is.numeric)

cor_data <- round(cor(numeric_data), 2)

melted_data <- melt(cor_data)

head(melted_data)

ggplot(data = melted_data, 
       aes(x = X1, 
           y = X2, 
           fill = value)
       ) + geom_tile() + ggtitle("Correlation Matrix")
### There is a strong negative correlation between Gross Profit Margin and Manufacturing Costs
### There is a Strong Positive correlation between Price and Gross Profit Margin.
### In essence we should investigate how to reduce manufacturing costs and increase prices
